"Hello! I'm Tristan, a software developer and undergraduate Computer Science student @ UWaterloo.\n\nAs a leader and developer in many projects, I lead by example by approaching opportunities with enthusiasm and creative perspectives. I like to be reliable and consistent and enjoy the challenge of working with new and unfamiliar technologies.\n\nI most recently interned at Plenty of Fish as a Machine Learning Engineer, working on developing and tuning various computer vision models for dating, as well as machine learning pipeline development. In the past I have interned at Arcturus Networks, where I worked on a real-time video monitoring applciation in a full stack capaciity. I also previously interned at WSIB Innovation Lab and Hop In as a Software Engineer. Academically, I am committed to my education and excel in my studies with a GPA of 3.9. I am also interested in AI/ML so I am pursuing the Artificial Intelligence Specialization option for my degree. I enjoy taking courses related to Machine Learning, Combinatorics, Statistics, and Languages.\n\nI am driven by passion and interest and generally dislike doing things just for the sake of doing them. Working on topics which interest me is extremely motivating and makes it easy to enjoy the work and stay consistent. This is reflected in the projects that I have worked on, as there are no generic projects, only those related to my interests, such as free burgers! Check them out further down :)\n\nIn addition to school and work, I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and have fun. I enjoy learning languages and travelling. My most recent adventure was a 5 month long international exchange to Hong Kong! I keep active by going to the gym and playing competitive soccer and volleyball.",
